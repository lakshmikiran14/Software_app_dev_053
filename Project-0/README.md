# Project - 0

* The webpage is a sketch blog. I've made a blog for my sketches and included all the specifications mention in the project-0 requirements.
* I've included 4 html pages - sketch.html,color.html,charcoal.html,pencil.html.
* I've included an unordered list in the menu , a table in the about me section.
* I've included images in all the 4 pages. In the color.html,charcoal.html,pencil.html pages, the image will become clearer/darker when you   hover over it.
* I've included a style sheet file for color.html
* 5 different css properties - color, width, height, font-size,background-image etc
* different css selectors - id in sketch.html, .row, .grid, header, .grid-item etc
* Used the concept of responsiveness: When the color.html window size is changed, it is indicated by the change in the color of the header.
